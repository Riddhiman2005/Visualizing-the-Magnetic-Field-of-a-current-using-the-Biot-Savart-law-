# Biot Savart Law # 

 The Biot-Savart law describes the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire
 providing a mathematical framework for calculating magnetic fields generated by current-carrying conductors, 
 enabling the understanding and design of various electromagnetic systems.<br>
 <br>
 
 ## Statement ##  
 <br>
 
 *The magnetic field at a point due to an infinitesimal segment of current-carrying wire, 
 is **directly proportional** to the **magnitude of the current**, the **length of the wire segment**, 
 **the sine of the angle between the wire segment and the line connecting the point to the segment**, 
 and **inversely proportional** to the **square of the distance between the point and the wire segment** *
 
 The Biot Savart Law can mathematically expressed below

 where B is the magnetic field vector at a point r, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current in the wire,
 dl is an infinitesimal length element of the wire, r’ is the vector from the length element to the point r, and the integral is taken over the entire wire C
