# Biot Savart Law # 

 The Biot-Savart law describes the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire
 providing a mathematical framework for calculating magnetic fields generated by current-carrying conductors, 
 enabling the understanding and design of various electromagnetic systems.<br>
 <br>
 
 ## Statement ##  
 <br>
 
 *The magnetic field at a point due to an infinitesimal segment of current-carrying wire, 
 is **directly proportional** to the **magnitude of the current**, the **length of the wire segment**, 
 **the sine of the angle between the wire segment and the line connecting the point to the segment**, 
 and **inversely proportional** to the **square of the distance between the point and the wire segment** *
 
 The Biot Savart Law can mathematically expressed below

 where **B** is the **magnetic field vector at a point r**, **μ₀** is the **permeability of free space**, **I** is the **current in the wire**,
 **dl** is an **infinitesimal length element of the wire**, **r’** is the **vector from the length element to the point r**, and the integral is taken over the entire wire C
