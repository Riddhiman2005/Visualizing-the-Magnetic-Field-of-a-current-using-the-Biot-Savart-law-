# Visualizing the Magnetic Field of a current using the Biot's Savart Law # 

Here, I discussed how can we visualize the magnetic field due to a current using the Biotâ€™s-Savart law using Python codes and plotting the curves in Matplotlib. I also added the Python codes, I used to generate the magnetic field plots for different conditons of current configurations.
